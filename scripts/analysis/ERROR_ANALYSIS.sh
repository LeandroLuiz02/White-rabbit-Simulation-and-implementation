echo "‚ùå PROBLEM: Missing VHDL dependencies in wr-cores"
echo "   Error: 'wishbone_pkg' is not compiled in library"
echo ""

echo "üìã ROOT CAUSE:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ White Rabbit cores have complex VHDL library dependencies"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Packages must be compiled in specific order:"
echo "     1. wishbone_pkg.vhd (base)"
echo "     2. wr_fabric_pkg.vhd (depends on wishbone)"  
echo "     3. endpoint_pkg.vhd (depends on both)"
echo "     4. Other WR modules"
echo ""

echo "üéØ AVAILABLE SOLUTIONS:"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ SOLUTION 1: Use Basic Version (RECOMMENDED)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Works without wr-cores dependencies"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Perfect for learning WR concepts"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Command: vivado -mode batch -source scripts/run_vivado_test.tcl"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ SOLUTION 2: Proper WR-Cores Setup (Advanced)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Requires proper wr-cores compilation"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Need to build wr-cores with correct makefiles"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Complex setup for advanced users only"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ SOLUTION 3: Mixed Approach"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Start with basic version for learning"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Later add real wr-cores when needed"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Best of both worlds"

echo "üöÄ RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:"
echo ""
echo "1. LEARN WITH BASIC VERSION:"
echo "   vivado -mode batch -source scripts/run_vivado_test.tcl"
echo ""
echo "2. UNDERSTAND WR CONCEPTS:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Read docs/TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Analyze basic simulation results"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Study waveforms and signals"
echo ""
echo "3. OPTIONAL - ADVANCED SETUP:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Only if you need real WR protocol simulation"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Requires significant wr-cores knowledge"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Alternative: Use basic version for most purposes"
echo ""

echo "üí° KEY INSIGHT:"
echo "   The basic version (simple_wr_testbench.sv) demonstrates"
echo "   all the important WR concepts without complex dependencies."
echo "   For most learning and development, it's sufficient!"

echo "========================================"
