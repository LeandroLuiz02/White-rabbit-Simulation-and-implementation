echo "🎯 CURRENT STATUS:"
echo "   ✅ You've mastered basic WR simulation"
echo "   ✅ You understand WR concepts and structure"
echo "   ✅ Vivado environment is working correctly"
echo ""

echo "🚀 NEXT STEPS FOR REAL IMPLEMENTATION:"
echo ""

echo "PHASE 1: WR-CORES SETUP (Foundation)"
echo "────────────────────────────────────────"
echo "1️⃣ Clone and build wr-cores repository"
echo "2️⃣ Understand WR-cores structure and libraries"
echo "3️⃣ Build WRPC software (wrc.bram)"
echo "4️⃣ Verify wr-cores compilation"
echo ""

echo "PHASE 2: HARDWARE TARGET (Choose Platform)"
echo "────────────────────────────────────────"
echo "5️⃣ Select target FPGA board (SPEC, KC705, etc.)"
echo "6️⃣ Download/setup board support package"
echo "7️⃣ Understand platform-specific constraints"
echo "8️⃣ Setup hardware debugging tools"
echo ""

echo "PHASE 3: IMPLEMENTATION (Build Real WR Node)"
echo "────────────────────────────────────────"
echo "9️⃣ Synthesize WR design for target FPGA"
echo "🔟 Implement place & route"
echo "1️⃣1️⃣ Generate bitstream"
echo "1️⃣2️⃣ Program FPGA and test"
echo ""

echo "PHASE 4: NETWORK SETUP (Two-Node Network)"
echo "────────────────────────────────────────"
echo "1️⃣3️⃣ Configure two WR nodes"
echo "1️⃣4️⃣ Setup ethernet connections"
echo "1️⃣5️⃣ Verify synchronization"
echo "1️⃣6️⃣ Measure timing performance"
echo ""

echo "📋 WHAT WE'LL START WITH:"
echo "   • Clone and setup wr-cores (the foundation)"
echo "   • Understand why each component is needed"
echo "   • Build your first real WR synthesis"
echo ""

echo "💡 WHY THIS ORDER:"
echo "   • Foundation first: Need working wr-cores"
echo "   • Simulation to hardware: Proven methodology"
echo "   • Single node then network: Step by step complexity"
echo "   • Measure results: Verify sub-nanosecond accuracy"
echo ""
